# Basefund is a financial safety net for donors to effective charities.

<!-- <div class=nobottommargin>![](cover.webp)</div> -->

Basefund maintains a hardship fund for people who donated to [effective charities](#eligible-charities). We believe effective philanthropists should run little risk of encountering financial trouble themselves.

*Basefund is currently in its trial phase. As such, payouts are capped to 1,000 USD, and we only assist people who donated in 2022 or 2023. The fund should not be relied on as a financial buffer. Basefund may halt operations at any point.*

## Applying

To apply for hardship assistance, fill in [this form](applicationform.pdf) and send it to in<span style='display: none;'>DONTCOPYTHIS</span>fo@basefund.org.

Anyone who has donated to [effective charities](#eligible-charities) can apply. As a part of the verification process, please request a copy of your donation receipts, cc'ing in<span style='display: none;'>DONTCOPYTHIS</span>fo@basefund.org:

> Dear Sir/Madam,
>
> Could you send a copy of my donation receipts to me and info@basefund.org (cc)? This is my donation history:
>
> - date - amount
> - date - amount
> - ...
>
> Best, [Your Name]

There is no need to wait for the charity's response before submitting your application for hardship assistance. We aim to review applications within 7 days. If your application is accepted, the amount you receive will be the **lowest** of three figures:

1. The payout suggested by the hardship examiner
2. 50% of your donations to cost-effective charities made in 2022 and 2023
3. 1,000 USD, or the equivalent amount in another currency

We ask potential applicants not to fret too much about whether they are experiencing hardship before applying. Usually, we'll be able to see right away whether an applicant is eligible.

## Donating

Basefund's hardship fund is financed by individual donors. It currently operates under the US fiscal sponsor Players Philantropy Fund, meaning donations are tax-deductible in the US. Our banking information can be found [here](Basefund-letter.pdf) and our pledge form can be found [here](Basefund-pledgeform.pdf). If your donation exceeds $1000 USD, please fill in the pledge form and send it to info@basefund.org.

## Eligible Charities

During the trial phase, donors to the following charities are eligible for hardship assistance:

- GiveWell
- All charities recommended by GiveWell
- The Life You Can Save
- All charities recommended by The Life You Can Save
- Giving What We Can
- All funds recommended by Giving What We Can
- All charities receiving funding from a fund recommended by Giving What We Can (this includes many long-termist charities)

Charities which fell into one of the above categories at the time of donating also count towards eligibility, even if the charity is no longer recommended at the time of applying.

## Cut-off Date

We currently only consider donations made on or after January 1, 2022. In the future, this cut-off date might slowly move to January 1, 2012.

## About

Basefund is chaired by Bob de Ruiter. Applications are reviewed by a team of three: Gabor Kocsi, Manuel Allgaier, and Bob de Ruiter.
